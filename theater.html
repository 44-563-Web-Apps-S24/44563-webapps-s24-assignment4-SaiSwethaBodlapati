The scene is laid in one of the rooms of Andronov's Restaurant<br>
<br>

<p style="color:red" class="direction">[A brilliantly illuminated room. A large table, laid for supper. Waiters<br>
in dress-jackets are fussing round the table. An orchestra behind the<br>
scene is playing the music of the last figure of a quadrille.]</p>

<p style="color:red" class="direction">[ANNA MARTINOVNA ZMEYUKINA, YATS, and a GROOMSMAN cross the stage.]</p>

<h6 class="ZMEYUKINA"><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b></h6><br><p class="speech">No, no, no!</p>

<h6 class="YATS"><b>YATS.</b></h6><p style="color:red" class="direction">[Following her] </p><p class="speech">Have pity on us! Have pity!</p>

<h6 class="ZMEYUKINA"><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b></h6><br><p class="speech">No, no, no!</p>

<h6 class="GROOMSMAN"><b>GROOMSMAN.</b></h6><p style="color:red" class="direction">[Chasing them] </p><p class="speech">You can't go on like this! Where are you off<br>
to? What about the _grand ronde? Grand ronde, s'il vous plait_!</p> <p style="color:red" class="direction">[They all go off.]</p>
<p style="color:red" class="direction">[Enter NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA and APLOMBOV.]</p>

<h6 class="NASTASYA_TIMOFEYEVNA"><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b></h6><br><p class="speech">You had much better be dancing than upsetting me<br>
with your speeches.</p>

<h6 class="APLOMBOV"><b>APLOMBOV.</b></h6><br><p class="speech">I'm not a Spinosa or anybody of that sort, to go making<br>
figures-of-eight with my legs. I am a serious man, and I have a<br>
character, and I see no amusement in empty pleasures. But it isn't just<br>
a matter of dances. You must excuse me, maman, but there is a good deal<br>
in your behaviour which I am unable to understand. For instance, in<br>
addition to objects of domestic importance, you promised also to give<br>
me, with your daughter, two lottery tickets. Where are they?<br>
</p>

<h6 class="NASTASYA_TIMOFEYEVNA"><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b></h6><br><p class="speech">My head's aching a little... I expect it's on<br>
account of the weather.... If only it thawed!</p>

<h6 class="APLOMBOV"><b>APLOMBOV.</b></h6><br><p class="speech"><p class="speech">You won't get out of it like that. I only found out to-day<br>
that those tickets are in pawn. You must excuse me, _maman_, but
it's only swindlers who behave like that. I'm not doing this out of
egoisticism</p> <p style="color:red" class="direction">[Note: So in the original]</p><p class="speech">--I don't want your tickets--but<br>
on principle; and I don't allow myself to be done by anybody. I have<br>
made your daughter happy, and if you don't give me the tickets to-day<br>
I'll make short work of her. I'm an honourable man!
</p>

<h6 class="NASTASYA_TIMOFEYEVNA"><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b></h6><p style="color:red" class="direction">[Looks round the table and counts up the covers]</p>
<p class="speech">One, two, three, four, five...</p>

<h6 class="A_WAITER"><b>A WAITER.</b></h6><br><p class="speech">The cook asks if you would like the ices served with rum,
madeira, or by themselves?</p>

<h6 class="APLOMBOV"><b>APLOMBOV.</b></h6><br><p class="speech">With rum. And tell the manager that there's not enough wine.
Tell him to prepare some more Haut Sauterne. </p><p style="color:red" class="direction">[To NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA]</p>
<p class="speech">You also promised and agreed that a general was to be here to supper.<br>
And where is he?</p>

<h6 class="NASTASYA_TIMOFEYEVNA"><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b></h6><br><p class="speech">That isn't my fault, my dear.</p>

<h6 class="APLOMBOV"><b>APLOMBOV.</b></h6>
<p class="speech">Whose fault, then?</p>

<h6 class="NASTASYA_TIMOFEYEVNA"><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b></h6>
<p class="speech">It's Andrey Andreyevitch's fault.... Yesterday he
came to see us and promised to bring a perfectly real general.</p><p style="color:red" class="direction">[Sighs]</p> <p class="speech">I suppose he couldn't find one anywhere, or he'd have brought him....
You think we don't mind? We'd begrudge our child nothing. A general, of<br>
course...</p>

<h6 class="APLOMBOV"><b>APLOMBOV.</b></h6>
<p class="speech">But there's more.... Everybody, including yourself, _maman_,<br>
is aware of the fact that Yats, that telegraphist, was after Dashenka<br>
before I proposed to her. Why did you invite him? Surely you knew it<br>
would be unpleasant for me?</p>
