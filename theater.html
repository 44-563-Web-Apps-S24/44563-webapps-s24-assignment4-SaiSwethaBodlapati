The scene is laid in one of the rooms of Andronov's Restaurant


<p style="color:red">[A brilliantly illuminated room. A large table, laid for supper. Waiters
in dress-jackets are fussing round the table. An orchestra behind the
scene is playing the music of the last figure of a quadrille.]</p>

<p style="color:red">[ANNA MARTINOVNA ZMEYUKINA, YATS, and a GROOMSMAN cross the stage.]</p>

<b>ZMEYUKINA.</b><br>No, no, no!

<b>YATS.</b><p style="color:red">[Following her] </p>Have pity on us! Have pity!

<b>ZMEYUKINA.</b><br>No, no, no!

<b>GROOMSMAN.</b> <p style="color:red">[Chasing them] </p>You can't go on like this! Where are you off
to? What about the _grand ronde? Grand ronde, s'il vous plait_! <p style="color:red">[They all go off.]</p>
<p style="color:red">[Enter NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA and APLOMBOV.]</p>

<b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b><br>You had much better be dancing than upsetting me
with your speeches.

<b>APLOMBOV.</b><br>I'm not a Spinosa or anybody of that sort, to go making
figures-of-eight with my legs. I am a serious man, and I have a
character, and I see no amusement in empty pleasures. But it isn't just
a matter of dances. You must excuse me, maman, but there is a good deal
in your behaviour which I am unable to understand. For instance, in
addition to objects of domestic importance, you promised also to give
me, with your daughter, two lottery tickets. Where are they?

<b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b><br>My head's aching a little... I expect it's on
account of the weather.... If only it thawed!

<b>APLOMBOV.</b><br>You won't get out of it like that. I only found out to-day
that those tickets are in pawn. You must excuse me, _maman_, but
it's only swindlers who behave like that. I'm not doing this out of
egoisticism <p style="color:red">[Note: So in the original]</p>--I don't want your tickets--but
on principle; and I don't allow myself to be done by anybody. I have
made your daughter happy, and if you don't give me the tickets to-day
I'll make short work of her. I'm an honourable man!

<b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b><p style="color:red">[Looks round the table and counts up the covers]</p>
One, two, three, four, five...

<b>A WAITER.</b><br>The cook asks if you would like the ices served with rum,
madeira, or by themselves?

<b>APLOMBOV.</b><br>With rum. And tell the manager that there's not enough wine.
Tell him to prepare some more Haut Sauterne. <p style="color:red">[To NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA]</p>
You also promised and agreed that a general was to be here to supper.
And where is he?

<b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b><br>That isn't my fault, my dear.

<b>APLOMBOV.</b>
Whose fault, then?

<b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> 
It's Andrey Andreyevitch's fault.... Yesterday he
came to see us and promised to bring a perfectly real general.<p style="color:red">[Sighs]</p> I suppose he couldn't find one anywhere, or he'd have brought him....
You think we don't mind? We'd begrudge our child nothing. A general, of
course...

<b>APLOMBOV.</b>
But there's more.... Everybody, including yourself, _maman_,
is aware of the fact that Yats, that telegraphist, was after Dashenka
before I proposed to her. Why did you invite him? Surely you knew it
would be unpleasant for me?
